Spring 2023   
In Spring 2023, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level MPH course “Health Informatics Essentials” at the Department of Health Informatics, St. Luke’s International University, Tokyo. My role included supporting instruction in the introductory modules on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, where I assisted students in understanding core computational methods and their applications in public health informatics. I also contributed to practical sessions, guiding students through coding exercises and data-driven problem-solving using real-world health datasets. Course materials and resources are openly available at the [Health Informatics, Spring 2023](https://github.com/tgyeltshen/Health_Informatics_Teaching_Spring2023)
