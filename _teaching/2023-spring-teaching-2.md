Teaching Assistant, Spring 2023 | Graduate School of Public Health, St. Luke’s International University, Tokyo  

In Spring 2023, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level MPH course *“Medical Informatics Essentials”* at the Department of Health Informatics, led by Associate Professor [Zoie Shui-Yee Wong](https://researchmap.jp/zoiewong).  

This course provided students with a foundational understanding of how digital health and informatics shape healthcare systems, improve decision-making, and influence public health policy.  

### My Role
- Supported instruction in introductory modules on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.  
- Assisted students in grasping computational methods and their applications in health informatics.  
- Facilitated **practical sessions** by guiding students through coding exercises, statistical analysis, and data-driven problem-solving using real-world health datasets.  
- Provided feedback on assignments and group projects, helping students apply informatics theories to public health challenges.
