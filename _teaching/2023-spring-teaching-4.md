Spring 2023|Global Health - Global Health SCiences       
The course, led by Professor [Junko Yasuoka](https://researchmap.jp/jyasuoka/?lang=en), provided students with a comprehensive overview of global health issues in both developing and developed contexts, emphasizing international collaboration mechanisms, including bilateral and multilateral partnerships, public–private partnerships, and the roles of key stakeholders such as WHO, JICA, and international NGOs. As a Teaching Assistant, I supported both the instructional and interactive components of the course. This included facilitating lectures and group discussions on major global health challenges such as communicable and non-communicable diseases, demographic transitions, health policy, community participation, gender and minority health, and outbreak response. I also assisted students with their individual and group assignments, provided feedback on presentations, and helped guide collaborative projects that required applying theoretical knowledge to real-world global health scenarios.  

This role allowed me to actively engage in fostering student learning by bridging theoretical concepts with practical case studies, while also supporting constructive discussions on the future direction of global health in the 21st century.
