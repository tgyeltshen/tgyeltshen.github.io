# Teaching Assistant – Global Health  
**Spring 2023 | St. Luke’s International University, Tokyo**  

The course, led by Professor [Junko Yasuoka](https://researchmap.jp/jyasuoka/?lang=en), provided students with a comprehensive overview of **global health issues** in both developing and developed contexts. It emphasized international collaboration mechanisms such as **bilateral and multilateral partnerships, public–private partnerships**, and the roles of key stakeholders including **WHO, JICA, and international NGOs**.  

### My Role  
As a Teaching Assistant, I supported both instructional and interactive components of the course:  
- Facilitated lectures and group discussions on major global health challenges: communicable and non-communicable diseases, demographic transitions, health policy, community participation, gender and minority health, and outbreak response.  
- Assisted students with **individual and group assignments**, providing constructive feedback on presentations.  
- Guided **collaborative projects** that applied theoretical knowledge to real-world global health scenarios.  
- Fostered discussions that connected course concepts to the **future direction of global health in the 21st century**.
