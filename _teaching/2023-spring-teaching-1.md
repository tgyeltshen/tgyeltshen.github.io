Spring 2023|Epidemiological Methods   
I served as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level MPH course “Epidemiological Methods” at the Department of Epidemiology, St. Luke’s International University, Tokyo, led by Professor [Mahbubur Rahman](https://researchmap.jp/rahman). The course introduced students to the fundamental principles of epidemiology as the core science of public health and disease prevention.  
My role included supporting both lectures and practical sessions on key methodological topics such as *epidemiological study designs, measures of disease occurrence and association, causal inference, confounding, effect modification, bias, and random error*. I also assisted in exercises focused on the critical *appraisal of epidemiological literature*, interpretation of study findings, and practical applications such as *outbreak investigation, surveillance, and evaluation of health services*. Furthermore, I guided students through structured class discussions and problem-solving activities, enabling them to connect theoretical concepts with real-world public health practice.  
This teaching role provided me with the opportunity to contribute to developing students’ ability to critically evaluate research evidence, apply epidemiological methods in practice, and prepare for writing and publishing epidemiological studies.
