Spring 2023   
I served as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level MPH course “Epidemiological Methods” at the Department of Epidemiology, St. Luke’s International University, Tokyo. I supported lectures and practical sessions covering key topics such as study designs, measures of association, confounders and effect modifiers, as well as errors in epidemiological studies, including bias and random error. Additionally, I assisted in guiding students through the fundamentals of outbreak investigation, helping them apply theoretical concepts to real-world public health scenarios.
