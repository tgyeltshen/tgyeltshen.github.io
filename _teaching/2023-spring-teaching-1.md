# Teaching Assistant – Epidemiological Methods  
**Spring 2023 | St. Luke’s International University, Tokyo**  

I served as a Teaching Assistant for the graduate-level MPH course *“Epidemiological Methods”* at the Department of Epidemiology, led by Professor [Mahbubur Rahman](https://researchmap.jp/rahman). The course introduced students to the fundamental principles of epidemiology as the core science of public health and disease prevention.  

### My Role  
- Supported lectures and practical sessions on **epidemiological study designs, measures of disease occurrence and association, causal inference, confounding, effect modification, bias, and random error**.  
- Assisted in exercises focused on **critical appraisal of epidemiological literature**, interpretation of study findings, and the application of epidemiologic methods in practice.  
- Guided students in applied topics such as **outbreak investigation, surveillance, screening, and evaluation of health services**.  
- Facilitated structured discussions and problem-solving activities that helped students connect theoretical concepts with real-world public health practice.  

This role allowed me to contribute to students’ ability to critically evaluate research evidence, apply epidemiological methods in practice, and develop skills for writing and publishing epidemiological studies.
