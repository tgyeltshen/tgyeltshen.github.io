# Teaching Assistant – Basic Tools of Population Health Research  
**Spring 2025 | The University of Tokyo, School of International Health**  

I facilitated a class for the course *“Basic Tools of Population Health Research”* offered by the [Department of Global Health Policy](https://www.ghp.m.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), School of International Health, The University of Tokyo.  

This intensive module is designed to introduce students to the **fundamental principles of epidemiology and medical statistics**, with a strong emphasis on applying these tools in public health research.  

### My Role  
- Facilitated both **conceptual lectures and applied practical sessions**.  
- Guided students in key areas such as **confounding, stratification, and effect modification**.  
- Supported integration of **statistical software (R)** in hands-on exercises, helping students run analyses, interpret outputs, and troubleshoot coding issues.  
- Encouraged students to critically engage with epidemiological methods, interpret population health data, and build foundational skills essential for **evidence-based research**.
