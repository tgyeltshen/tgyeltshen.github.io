Spring 2025   
Global Health Policy - Basic Tools of population Health Research   
I facilitated a class for the course “Basic Tools of Population Health Research.” This intensive module is designed to introduce students to the fundamental principles of epidemiology and medical statistics, with a focus on applying these tools in public health research. My role included guiding students through both conceptual lectures and applied practical sessions, particularly in areas such as confounding, stratification, and effect modification, while also supporting the integration of statistical software (R) into hands-on exercises. The facilitation provided students with opportunities to critically engage with epidemiological methods, interpret population health data, and build foundational skills essential for evidence-based research
