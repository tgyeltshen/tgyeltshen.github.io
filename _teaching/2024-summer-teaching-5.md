Facilitator, 2nd Asia Summer Program, 2024 | The University of Tokyo, School of International Health, Department of Global Health Policy  

## Facilitator Role - Time-series Regression for Public Health      
I participated as a facilitator in the 2nd Asia Summer School 2024 on *Time-series Regression for Public Health*, an advanced short course designed to strengthen technical capacity in environmental and public-health time-series analyses.  

The school focused on applying **modern epidemiological designs (time-series, case-crossover, distributed-lag models, interrupted-time-series, multi-location studies)** to assess health impacts of environmental exposures such as air pollution and extreme temperatures.

## My Contributions
- **Supported both conceptual lectures and practical R-based sessions**, assisting instructors during hands-on coding exercises.  
- **Guided participants** in building and interpreting **time-series and distributed-lag models** for real-world environmental-health datasets.  
- Helped troubleshoot **R scripts, package installation, and data-handling issues** to ensure smooth participation during labs.  
- Facilitated **group work and discussions** on model interpretation, assumptions, and presentation of epidemiologic evidence.  
- Provided feedback on **group presentations** and encouraged collaborative problem-solving and peer-learning.

## Skills & Tools
- Epidemiologic study designs: **time-series, case-crossover, distributed-lag, interrupted-time-series, multi-site meta-analysis**  
- **R** and **RStudio** for data manipulation, visualization, and regression modelling  
- Application of **cross-basis functions (DLNM)** for distributed-lag effects  
- Meta-analytic techniques and heterogeneity assessment (Cochran Q, I²)  
- Collaborative facilitation and technical mentoring in an international training environment
