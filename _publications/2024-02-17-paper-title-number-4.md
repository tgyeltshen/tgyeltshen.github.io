# Lifestyle Management of Hypertension: International Society of Hypertension Position Paper  

This landmark **position paper by the International Society of Hypertension (ISH)**, endorsed by the **World Hypertension League (WHL)** and the **European Society of Hypertension (ESH)**, synthesizes the latest global evidence on lifestyle interventions for the prevention and management of hypertension.  

### Background  
- Hypertension remains the **leading preventable cause of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality worldwide**.  
- While pharmacological treatments are effective, lifestyle management forms the cornerstone of both **prevention and long-term control**.  
- This consensus paper provides practical, evidence-based recommendations to guide clinicians, policymakers, and public health practitioners.  

### Key Recommendations  
- **Dietary Interventions**  
  - Reduce dietary sodium intake to <2 g/day.  
  - Adopt the **DASH diet** and increase intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.  
  - Limit consumption of processed foods, sugar, and alcohol.  

- **Physical Activity**  
  - At least **150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise** or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.  
  - Incorporation of resistance training 2â€“3 times weekly.  

- **Weight Management**  
  - Target body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/mÂ².  
  - Structured programs for weight reduction in overweight/obese individuals.  

- **Tobacco and Alcohol**  
  - Complete elimination of tobacco use.  
  - Alcohol limited to â‰¤2 standard drinks/day for men and â‰¤1 for women.  

- **Sleep and Stress Management**  
  - Prioritize sleep hygiene and aim for 7â€“9 hours of sleep.  
  - Integrate stress-reduction practices (e.g., mindfulness, meditation).  

### Implications  
- Effective lifestyle interventions can reduce systolic blood pressure by **5â€“10 mmHg**, comparable to single-drug therapy.  
- Policy-level measures (e.g., food reformulation, urban planning, taxation) are essential to support individual behavior change.  
- The paper underscores that **multisectoral action** is critical to tackling hypertension globally, especially in **low- and middle-income countries** where the burden is highest.
