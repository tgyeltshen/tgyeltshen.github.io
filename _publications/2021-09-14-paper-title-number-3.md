This study investigated an outbreak of oral ulcers, predominantly glossitis, that occurred in September 2018 across three central schools in Tsirang district, Bhutan. A total of **204 students** were clinically assessed, with the majority presenting symptoms such as burning sensation, tongue pain, impaired taste, and intolerance to spicy foods.  

The outbreak investigation combined **clinical examinations, nutritional surveys, and laboratory analyses**. Results indicated inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B complex (particularly riboflavin and folate) and iron. Laboratory findings confirmed below-normal levels of certain micronutrients, while cytology tests identified fungal elements in some cases.  

The study concluded that **nutritional deficiencies** in school-provided meals contributed significantly to the outbreak. It recommended strengthening the **school feeding program** to ensure a balanced diet, with fortified foods and adequate micronutrient supply to prevent future outbreaks.  

This was the **first documented outbreak of glossitis in Bhutan**, providing critical evidence for policymakers to improve student nutrition and school health programs.
