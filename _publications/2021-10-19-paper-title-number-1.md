# Alcohol Policy Compliance among Retailers in Bhutan: A Multisite Community Intervention Study  

This study is the first **multisite evaluation of alcohol sales compliance** in Bhutan, addressing a major public health issue given the high burden of alcohol-related disease and mortality.  

### Background  
- Alcohol-related liver disease is the **leading cause of mortality** in Bhutanâ€™s hospitals, contributing to 11% of facility deaths in 2019.  
- Despite a comprehensive set of alcohol laws (age restrictions, prohibition of sales to intoxicated persons, limited hours, and Tuesday bans), enforcement has historically been weak.  
- Drinking begins early in Bhutan; one-third of adults are current drinkers, and 24% of students under 18 report current alcohol use.  

### Methods  
- **Design:** Pre- and post-test community intervention in **four district towns** (Damphu, Pema Gatshel, Khuruthang, and Bajo).  
- **Retailers:** All licensed outlets were included, both **on-premise** (bars, hotels, restaurants, karaoke) and **off-premise** (grocery shops).  
- **Intervention:** Retailers received:  
  - Briefings by district officials (health, trade, and police).  
  - A laminated notification of alcohol rules to display prominently.  
  - Warnings of enforcement and legal consequences.  
- **Compliance Testing:** Purchases attempted by:  
  - *Underage-looking young adults* (>18 but appearing <18).  
  - *Adults feigning intoxication*.  
  - *Sober adults*.  
- A total of **854 purchase attempts** were recorded.  

### Results  
- **Baseline compliance was poor**: only **17.3% refusal** of illegal sales overall.  
- Post-intervention, compliance **increased by 22.7%** (95% CI: 8.6â€“37.0).  
- Improvements were strongest in refusal to:  
  - Underage-looking patrons (increase of 27.8%).  
  - Pseudo-intoxicated patrons (increase of 21.9%).  
  - Sales on Tuesdays (increase of 19.3%).  
- Establishments displaying alcohol regulation signage were **3 times more likely** to comply with laws (OR 3.01, 95% CI: 1.67â€“5.36).  
- Compliance was weaker in **busy establishments**, highlighting operational challenges.  

### Discussion & Implications  
- The intervention demonstrated that **brief education and legal reinforcement** can significantly improve compliance, but absolute compliance levels (38% post-intervention) remained low.  
- **Tuesday bans** were relatively better enforced than **hour restrictions**, likely due to ease of implementation.  
- Stronger and sustained **enforcement mechanisms**, combined with **periodic retailer education** and mandatory signage, are needed.  
- Findings highlight the importance of targeting underage sales prevention to reduce early initiation of alcohol use in Bhutan.  

### Conclusion  
The study underscores that while Bhutan has strong alcohol laws, **compliance is weak without active enforcement and education**. A community-based intervention improved outcomes but must be complemented by **regular inspections, stricter penalties, and public awareness campaigns** to sustain progress.
