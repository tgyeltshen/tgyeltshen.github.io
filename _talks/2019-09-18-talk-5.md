# People-Centered Healthcare for Tsirang and Punakha: PEN HEARTS Initiatives  

At the **Fifth Biennial Health Conference (BHC)**, convened by the Ministry of Health under the theme *‚ÄúEnhancing Integrated People-Centered Health Services‚Äù*, I presented on *‚ÄúTransforming NCD Care by Keeping People at the Heart of Care: PEN HEARTS Initiatives in Tsirang and Punakha.‚Äù* The presentation highlighted the shift from the former PEN programme‚Äîmarked by limited recall, referral, and follow-up‚Äîto the **people-centered PEN HEARTS model**, emphasizing continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness in chronic disease care.  

Through real-world examples, district-level innovations, and community outreach activities, the talk illustrated how improved recall/reminder systems, medicine refills at Basic Health Units (BHUs), mentoring, and active doctor engagement enhanced outcomes for patients with hypertension and diabetes while also strengthening health systems and staff morale.    

- **Implications & Recommendations**:  
  - Reduce treatment interruptions for NCD patients through structured recall and reminder systems.  
  - Minimize travel costs and time by enabling refills and outreach care at BHU level.  
  - Strengthen team-based care and health system leadership through mentoring and supportive supervision.  
  - Scale up PEN HEARTS as a **national program** to standardize chronic care across Bhutan.  
  - Extend people-centered approaches to other services (communicable diseases, maternal & child health, mental health).  
  - Ensure transport and logistics systems are formalized to support community medicine refills.
