### About the Presentation

Socioeconomic status significantly impacts participation in life-saving cancer screenings—a persistent public health challenge. This presentation highlights findings from my study on screening trends in Japan and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Study Overview

I analyzed a decade (2013–2022) of data from Japan's Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, covering approximately 500,000 people per year. The research tracked age-standardized screening rates for **stomach, lung, colon, breast, and cervical cancers**, stratified by education level.

#### Key Findings

* **A Stark Educational Divide:** A clear gap exists between education levels. This was most pronounced in stomach cancer screening, where 2022 rates for highly educated men (58.2%) were more than double those with low education (28.3%).
* **Minor Overall Pandemic Impact:** Between 2019 and 2022, overall screening rates changed only slightly. For example, stomach cancer screening dipped by just 1.2% for men and 1.0% for women.
* **The Pandemic Worsened Inequality:** The pandemic's impact was not felt equally. For instance, breast cancer screening declined by **3.1%** among women with low education, compared to only a **1.0%** decline for their more educated counterparts.

While the pandemic had a minimal overall effect on cancer screening, it disproportionately harmed individuals with a lower socioeconomic status, underscoring the urgent need for targeted public health interventions.
