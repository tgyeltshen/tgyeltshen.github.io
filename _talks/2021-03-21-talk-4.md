# Oral Health & Dentistry in Bhutan: A Public Health Urgency  

At the **Oral Health Policy Dialogue** hosted by the Faculty of Postgraduate Medicine, Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (KGUMSB), I presented on *‚ÄúOral Health and Dentistry in Bhutan: A Public Health Urgency.‚Äù*  

### Talk Overview  
- **Background & Aim**: Highlighted the rising burden of oral diseases in Bhutan, including dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer, and framed oral health as an urgent public health issue requiring systemic response.  
- **Methods & Evidence**: Drew on national statistics (Annual Health Bulletin, STEPS Survey, Bhutan Statistical Yearbook) and clinical case illustrations to underscore unmet needs in oral health services.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Oral diseases are highly prevalent among children, pregnant mothers, and adults, with over half the population never accessing dental services:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
  - Common risk behaviors (betel quid, tobacco, alcohol) drive both oral and non-communicable disease burdens:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
  - Limited oral health workforce, lack of integration into national health programs, and absence of specialized services exacerbate inequalities.  
- **Implications & Recommendations**:  
  - Strengthening of the **National Oral Health Program** within the Ministry of Health.  
  - Establishment of a **National Dental Hospital** and **Faculty of Dentistry** at KGUMSB.  
  - Integration of oral health into broader NCD prevention and primary health care.  
  - Increased funding, workforce training, and preventive health promotion activities.
