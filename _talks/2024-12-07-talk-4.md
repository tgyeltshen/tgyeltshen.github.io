# Healthcare Landscapes in Bhutan: Past, Present and Future Scopes

### Talk Overview  
- **Historical Context**: Highlighted Bhutan’s reliance on indigenous medicine and the late adoption of modern healthcare due to centuries of isolation.  
- **Current System**: Described the universal free healthcare model (Beveridge-type) and its integration with traditional medicine.  
- **Key Achievements**: Improved life expectancy, significant reductions in maternal and child mortality.  
- **Challenges**: Addressed the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, alcohol-related mortality, geographic access barriers, and financial sustainability of healthcare.  
- **Future Directions**: Emphasized strengthening primary healthcare, investing in the health workforce, adopting digital health solutions, and preparing for paradigm shifts in health promotion.
