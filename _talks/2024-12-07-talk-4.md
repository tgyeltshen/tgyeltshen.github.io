In this symposium, I delivered an oral presentation titled “Healthcare Landscapes in Bhutan: Past, Present and Future Scopes.” The talk began with an overview of Bhutan’s historical healthcare landscape, highlighting the country’s long reliance on indigenous medicine and the delayed introduction of modern healthcare services due to its centuries-long policy of isolation. I then discussed the current healthcare system, which provides universal free healthcare under a Beveridge-type model, while also integrating traditional medicine. Achievements such as improved life expectancy and reduced maternal and child mortality were outlined alongside pressing challenges, including the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, alcohol-related mortality, geographic barriers, and sustainability of health financing. Finally, I concluded with a reflection on the way forward, emphasizing the need for strengthening primary healthcare, investing in the health workforce, adopting digital health solutions, and preparing for future paradigm shifts in health promotion
