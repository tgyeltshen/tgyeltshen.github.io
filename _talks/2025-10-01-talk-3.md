In this talk, I discussed on the intersection of **climate change, health, and social inequality**, with a particular focus on Mongolia and other climate-vulnerable regions in the world. 

Key themes include:
- **Global Climate Trends:** Historical warming patterns and future projections under different emissions pathways (SSPs).  
- **Health Impacts of Warming:** How even a 1–2 °C rise intensifies heat stress, respiratory diseases, nutrition challenges, and mental-health risks.  
- **Vulnerable Populations:** Disproportionate burdens faced by children, older adults, women, rural and low-income communities.  
- **Mongolia’s Climate-Risk Profile:** Warming by ≈ 2.2 °C since 1940, shrinking glaciers and lakes, expanding arid zones, and health threats from drought-driven dust storms.  
- **Gender and Health Inequities:** How social, economic, and biological factors combine to heighten women’s vulnerability.  
- **Case Study – Japan:** Evidence of intergenerational inequities in the health burden of lifetime exposure to extreme heat.  
- **Pathways to Action:** Mitigation, targeted adaptation, and resilient health systems to protect equity in a warming world.

The session highlighted that while **climate-related health risks are unavoidable, their severity is not**. Timely emission reductions and inclusive adaptation strategies can substantially reduce harm and advance health equity across the globe.
