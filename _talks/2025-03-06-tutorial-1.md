# Impact of Cumulative Exposure to Extreme Heat â€“ Intergenerational Inequities of Health Burden in Japan  

At the **UTCCS Annual Workshop 2025**, I presented a poster on my doctoral research exploring the *largely unexplored long-term mortality effects of cumulative heat exposure in Japan*.  

### Poster Overview  
- **Background & Rationale**  
  - Climate change has led to increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, raising the risk of heat-related mortality.  
  - While short-term mortality associations with extreme heat are well established, the long-term effects of *cumulative lifetime exposure* remain under-investigated:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  

- **Aims & Objectives**  
  1. Investigate the long-term effects of cumulative exposure to extreme heat on mortality risks and Years of Life Lost (YLL).  
  2. Assess intergenerational disparities in health burdens to inform targeted climate adaptation strategies.  

- **Methods**  
  - Synthetic cohort of **49.75 million death records (1972â€“2022)** linked with long-term meteorological data (1875â€“2022).  
  - Extreme heat days defined by the **95th percentile threshold (1880â€“1950 baseline)** per prefecture.  
  - YLL calculated using Japanese life tables (MHLW) and assigned exposure histories across individual lifespans.  

- **Key Findings**  
  - Extreme heat days have risen sharply in recent decades across all prefectures.  
  - YLL increases with age and is higher among older birth cohorts due to cumulative exposure.  
  - Intergenerational differences suggest varying vulnerability to lifetime heat exposure, highlighting potential inequities in health burden.  

- **Discussion & Implications**  
  - The study demonstrates the **growing burden of heat-related YLL** in Japan and highlights the importance of incorporating a life-course and generational perspective in climateâ€“health research.  
  - Findings provide evidence to guide **future climate adaptation and health equity strategies**.
