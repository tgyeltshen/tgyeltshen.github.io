In this symposium, I gave an oral talk on two projects that I worked on using the Japanese Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions (CSLC) data. The first project examined “Trends in Socioeconomic Inequalities in Cancer Screening Rates Before and After COVID-19 in Japan,” where I presented evidence of widening disparities in screening uptake across sex and education levels during the pandemic. The second project focused on “Trends, Socioeconomic Inequalities and Determinants of Self-Reported Diagnosed Diabetes Prevalence in Japan (1986–2019)” highlighting long-term patterns and persistent inequalities by occupational class and educational level. Together, these studies underscore the importance of addressing structural determinants of health to reduce inequalities and strengthen Japan’s public health resilience.
