# Data Analysis using Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions (CSLC), Japan  

At the **Kagoshima Data Science Symposium** (July 2025), I delivered an oral presentation on two projects based on analyses of the Japanese *Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions (CSLC)* data.  

### Talk Overview  
- **Project 1 – Cancer Screening**  
  *“Trends in Socioeconomic Inequalities in Cancer Screening Rates Before and After COVID-19 in Japan”*  
  - Presented evidence of widening disparities in screening uptake by **sex** and **educational level** during the pandemic.  

- **Project 2 – Diabetes Prevalence**  
  *“Trends, Socioeconomic Inequalities, and Determinants of Self-Reported Diagnosed Diabetes Prevalence in Japan (1986–2019)”*  
  - Highlighted long-term patterns and persistent inequalities by **occupational class** and **education level**.  

### Key Implications  
Together, these studies underscore the importance of addressing **structural determinants of health** to reduce inequalities and strengthen Japan’s public health resilience.
