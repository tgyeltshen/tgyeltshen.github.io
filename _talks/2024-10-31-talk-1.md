In this talk, I presented on “Trends in Socioeconomic Inequalities in Cancer Screening Rates Before and After COVID-19 in Japan.” The talk outlined the study’s background and aims, emphasizing how the pandemic may have influenced cancer screening behaviors across different population groups. Using nationally representative survey data, I described the methodology and analysis, focusing on socioeconomic and educational disparities in screening uptake. The results showed significant declines and widening inequalities, particularly among certain subgroups stratified by sex and education level, in the period following COVID-19. I concluded by discussing the public health implications, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions to reduce inequities and ensure resilient cancer screening systems in Japan
